# Score - EdTech Platform Setup Guide  

**Vendatu** is a modern EdTech platform built using the **MERN stack**. The project is structured with a clear separation between the frontend and backend, making it easy to understand and maintain.  

---

## 📁 Project Overview  

The project is organized into the following structure:  
```
vendatu/
├── frontend/ # React + Vite application  
├── server/ # Node.js + Express backend  
└── README.md # Project documentation  
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup  

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:  

   ```bash
   cd server  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  

   ```bash
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Configure your server `.env` file with the following variables:  

   ```makefile
   PORT=8000  
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string  
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key  
   ```  

4. Start the server:  

   ```bash
   npm start  
   ```

   ```bash
   cd frontend  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  

   ```bash
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Configure your frontend `.env` file with the following variables:  

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  
   # Add other necessary environment variables as needed  
   ```  

4. Start the development server:

## 🌐 Access Points  
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (default Vite port)  
- **Backend**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)  

---

## 📋 Dependencies  
Ensure you have the following installed and set up on your system:  
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)  
- **npm** or **yarn** (Node.js package managers)  
- **MongoDB** (Installed and running locally or remotely)  
- A **modern web browser** (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox)  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes  
- Ensure **MongoDB** is running before starting the backend server.  
- The **backend server** must be running for the frontend to function properly.  
- Check the console output for both frontend and backend during execution for any error messages.  
- Verify that all required **environment variables** are correctly configured.
